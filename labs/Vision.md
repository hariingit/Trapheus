**Introducing Trapheus Labs: Harnessing the Power of AI and Machine Learning for Data**

Trapheus Labs is a research lab that is focussed on exploring the potential of AI and machine learning in the field of data systems.Our vision is that AI/ML will be the next major computing platform and more ubiquitous than web/mobile. Beyond the sheer value that Trapheus delivers today in providing cutting-edge database management tools that simplify and streamline the process of managing  databases, we  do believe that there is immense potential to further optimize and automate various aspects of data management such as simple to complex data analysis to decipher insights

We want to make data analysis and develop systems that can infer knowledge from varied datasets that would have taken a lot of effort to uncover otherwise. We understand that in general humans have a limited ability to work with vast amounts of information. Our goal is to make this accessible to folks without a lot of cumbersome code and do it at scale.

That said, it's worth noting a few things,

Features developed in  Labs are experimental in nature and may require further fine-tuning before they can be fully integrated into our product offerings. We encourage our community to provide feedback and suggestions to help us improve these algorithms and make them better suited to your needs.
